        imagePath: "images/352_solution.png", 
        blog: "I first approached this problem via the “Random Question” button, and the gears in my head immediately started turning. This question requires the design of multiple functions, but when I heard the word “disjoint”, I immediately thought of CPSC 221, and our discussion surrounding disjoint sets. I started to draw a diagram of the first test-case, and then I implemented the addNum function using an unordered map. Thankfully, this intuition brought me surprisingly close to the solution with very little error. My second intuition was to add each value to an array that I would sort at the beginning of each getIntervals call. With some debugging, this design eventually worked with perfect runtime, and decent memory usage."

        blog: "Unique paths III is considered an “easy” hard problem, but I found it incredibly useful for developing recursive intuition that would leak its way into many other hard problems I tried. I knew I had to implement a backtracking algorithm as this problem seemed familiar to me from the many graph-related problems I solved in CPSC 110. The key to this problem was to create a boolean matrix that could represent visited paths. Here, the backtracking algorithm would move the character in each orthogonal direction. What finally alowed me to solve this problem was allowing the character to move out of bounds, subsequently pruning this case from the backtracking algorithm entirely. With a lot of debugging, I solved this problem with perfect time and decent memory usage."

        blog: "This is the only hard binary tree problem I have solved so far, and I found it to be less challenging than many medium difficulty problems that made me nearly lose my mind. After staring at this problem on pen and paper for nearly 20 minutes, I came to the conclusion that I could store node information in a hashmap, and use the associated values to generate a binary tree in order that the nodes were given to me. Sadly, I eventually realized that these numbers can be bigger than 9. From here, I used a while loop to identify each number, and I finally debugged the code. This solution has a fast runtime and decent memory usage."

I thought of many non-working solutions to this problem over the past few months, but I finally came to my solution fairly quickly after solving “Trapping Rain Water”. Upon writing a few of my own test cases with pen and paper, I got the intuition that I could sweep back and forth through the array, storing potential values in a hashmap. By taking the maximum of these two values my solution finally worked. It does not have great runtime or memory usage."

        blog: "This problem is entirely math-based, and it did not take me too long to solve. I used Desmos, the graphing calculator to help represent the data of the test-cases, and some of my own. I quickly came to the conclusion that points with a similar slope could be found on the same line, and with some grade-9 math and a lot of edge-cases, my solution worked with okay runtime and memory usage."

The amount of edge-cases in my original solution became unbearable, but by reconsidering the state of the problem and how the expression evolved with additional characters, I found the solution to be tolerable. This problem was also made easier with my understanding of DFA’s from CPSC 121. My solution has okay runtime and decent memory usage."

I don’t remember how I first encountered this problem, but my knowledge of merge sort from CPSC 221 saved my life. With the use of linked lists and while loops I developed my solution somewhat quickly. I also chose not to solve this problem recursively, because at this time my recursive intuition with C++ was not a strength of mine, and I could debug/visualise the problem much better using conditional loops."

I pretty quickly came to the conclusion that I would have to use a sliding window to ensure this problem could finish executing before the day was over. With the addition of a hashmap to store values, I finally got working code. My solution does not have great runtime or memory usage."

Unfortunately, my runtime and memory usage for this problem are pretty terrible, but my idea to use a monotonic stack that scans back and forth through the array helped me solve many later problems, like Candy."
